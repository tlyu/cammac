        Abstract: This document specifies a Kerberos Authorization
        Data container that supersedes AD-KDC-ISSUED. It allows for
        multiple Message Authentication Codes (MACs) or signatures to
        authenticate the contained Authorization Data elements.  This
        document updates RFC 4120.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        This document specifies a new Authorization Data container for
        Kerberos, called AD-CAMMAC (Container Authenticated by
        Multiple MACs), that supersedes AD-KDC-ISSUED. This new
        container allows both the receiving application service and
        the Key Distribution Center (KDC) itself to verify the
        authenticity of the contained authorization data. The
        AD-CAMMAC container can also include additional verifiers that
        "trusted services" can use to verify the contained
        authorization data.

    </section>

    <section title="Motivations">
      <t>
        The Kerberos protocol allows clients to submit arbitrary
        authorization data for a KDC to insert into a Kerberos ticket.
        These client-requested authorization data allow the client to
        express authorization restrictions that the application
        service will interpret.  With few exceptions, the KDC can
        safely copy these client-requested authorization data to the
        issued ticket without necessarily inspecting, interpreting, or
        filtering their contents.
      </t>
      <t>
        The AD-KDC-ISSUED authorization data container specified in
        <xref target="RFC4120">RFC 4120</xref> is a means for KDCs to
        include positive or permissive (rather than restrictive)
        authorization data in service tickets in a way that the
        service named in a ticket can verify that the KDC has issued
        the contained authorization data.  This capability takes
        advantage of a shared symmetric key between the KDC and the
        service to assure the service that the KDC did not merely copy
        client-requested authorization data to the ticket without
        inspecting them.
      </t>
      <t>
        The AD-KDC-ISSUED container works well for situations where
        the flow of authorization data is from the KDC to the service.
        However, protocol extensions such as Constrained Delegation
        (<xref target="MS-SFU">S4U2Proxy</xref>) require that a
        service present to the KDC a service ticket that the KDC
        previously issued, as evidence that the service is authorized
        to impersonate the client principal named in that ticket.  In
        the S4U2Proxy extension, the KDC uses the evidence ticket as
        the basis for issuing a derivative ticket that the service can
        then use to impersonate the client.  The authorization data
        contained within the evidence ticket constitute a flow of
        authorization data from the application service to the KDC.
        The properties of the AD-KDC-ISSUED container are insufficient
        for this use case because the service knows the symmetric key
        for the checksum in the AD-KDC-ISSUED container.  Therefore,
        the KDC has no way to detect whether the service has tampered
        with the contents of the AD-KDC-ISSUED container within the
        evidence ticket.
      </t>
      <t>
        The new AD-CAMMAC authorization data container specified in
        this document improves upon AD-KDC-ISSUED by including
        additional verifier elements.  The svc-verifier element of the
        CAMMAC has the same functional and security properties as the
        ad-checksum element of AD-KDC-ISSUED; the svc-verifier allows
        the service to verify the integrity of the AD-CAMMAC contents
        as it already could with the AD-KDC-ISSUED container.  The
        kdc-verifier and other-verifiers elements are new to AD-CAMMAC
        and provide its enhanced capabilities.
      </t>
      <t>
        The kdc-verifier element of the AD-CAMMAC container allows a
        KDC to verify the integrity of authorization data that it
        previously inserted into a ticket, by using a key that only
        the KDC knows.  The KDC thus avoids recomputing all of the
        authorization data for the issued ticket; this operation might
        not always be possible when that data includes ephemeral
        information such as the strength or type of authentication
        method used to obtain the original ticket.
      </t>
      <t>
        The verifiers in the other-verifiers element of the AD-CAMMAC
        container are not required, but can be useful when a
        lesser-privileged service receives a ticket from a client and
        needs to extract the CAMMAC to demonstrate to a
        higher-privileged "trusted service" on the same host that it
        is legitimately acting on behalf of that client.  The trusted
        service can use a verifier in the other-verifiers element to
        validate the contents of the CAMMAC without further
        communication with the KDC.

    <section title="Encoding">
      <t>
        The Kerberos protocol is defined in <xref target="RFC4120"/>
        using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) <xref
        target="X.680"/> and using the ASN.1 Distinguished Encoding
        Rules (DER) <xref target="X.690"/>. For consistency, this
        specification also uses ASN.1 for specifying the layout of
        AD-CAMMAC.  The ad-data of the AD-CAMMAC authorization data
        element is the ASN.1 DER encoding of the AD-CAMMAC ASN.1 type

            AD-CAMMAC.  The identifier, kvno, and enctype fields help
            the recipient locate the key required for verifying the
            MAC.  For the kdc-verifier and the svc-verifier, the

            context and MAY be omitted.  For the kdc-verifier, the MAC
            is computed differently than for the svc-verifier and the
            other-verifiers, as described later.  The key usage for
            computing the MAC (Checksum) is 64.
          </t>

          <t hangText="kdc-verifier:">

            A Verifier-MAC where the key is a long-term key of the
            local Ticket-Granting Service (TGS).  The checksum type is
            the required checksum type for the enctype of the TGS key.
            In contrast to the other Verifier-MAC elements, the KDC
            computes the MAC in the kdc-verifier over the ASN.1 DER
            encoding of the EncTicketPart of the surrounding ticket,
            but where the AuthorizationData value in the EncTicketPart
            contains the AuthorizationData value contained in the
            CAMMAC instead of the AuthorizationData value that would
            otherwise be present in the ticket.  This altered
            Verifier-MAC computation binds the kdc-verifier to the
            other contents of the ticket, assuring the KDC that a
            malicious service has not substituted a mismatched CAMMAC
            received from another ticket.

            A Verifier-MAC where the key is the same long-term service
            key that the KDC uses to encrypt the surrounding ticket.
            The checksum type is the required checksum type for the
            enctype of the service key used to encrypt the ticket.
            This field MUST be present if the service principal of the
            ticket is not the local TGS, including when the ticket is

            Verifier-MAC, the key is a long-term key of the principal
            name specified in the identifier field.  The PrincipalName
            MUST be present and be a valid principal in the realm.
            KDCs MAY add one or more "trusted service" verifiers.
            Unless otherwise administratively configured, the KDC
            SHOULD determine the "trusted service" principal name by
            replacing the service identifier component of the sname of
            the surrounding ticket with "host".  The checksum is
            computed using a long-term key of the identified
            principal, and the checksum type is the required checksum
            type for the enctype of that long-term key.  The kvno and
            enctype SHOULD be specified to disambiguate which of the
            long-term keys of the trusted service is used.

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        Although authorization data are generally conveyed within the
        encrypted part of a ticket and are thereby protected by the
        existing encryption scheme used for the surrounding ticket,
        some authorization data requires the additional protection
        provided by the CAMMAC.
      </t>
      <t>
        Some protocol extensions such as S4U2Proxy allow the KDC to
        issue a new ticket based on an evidence ticket provided by the
        service.  If the evidence ticket contains authorization data
        that needs to be preserved in the new ticket, then the KDC
        MUST revalidate it.
      </t>
      <t>
        Extracting a CAMMAC from a ticket for use as a credential
        removes it from the context of the ticket. In the general
        case, this could turn it into a bearer token, with all of the
        associated security implications. Also, the CAMMAC does not
        itself necessarily contain sufficient information to identify
        the client principal. Therefore, application protocols that
        rely on extracted CAMMACs might need to duplicate a
        substantial portion of the ticket contents and include that
        duplicated information in the authorization data contained
        within the CAMMAC. The extent of this duplication would depend
        on the security properties required by the application
        protocol.
      </t>
      <t>
        The method for computing the kdc-verifier does not bind it to
        any authorization data within the ticket but outside of the
        CAMMAC.  At least one (non-standard) authorization data type,
        AD-SIGNEDPATH, attempts to bind to other authorization data in
        a ticket, and it is very difficult for two such authorization
        data types to coexist.
      </t>
      <t>
        To minimize ticket size when embedding CAMMACs in Kerberos
        tickets, a KDC MAY omit the kdc-verifier from the CAMMAC when
        it is not needed.  In this situation, the KDC cannot always
        determine whether the CAMMAC contents are intact.  The KDC
        MUST NOT create a new CAMMAC from an existing one unless the
        existing CAMMAC has a valid kdc-verifier, with two exceptions.
      </t>
      <t>
        Only KDCs for the local realm have knowledge of the local TGS
        key, so the outer encryption of a local TGT is sufficient to
        protect the CAMMAC of a local TGT from tampering, assuming
        that all of the KDCs in the local realm consistently filter
        out CAMMAC authorization data submitted by clients.  The KDC
        MAY create a new CAMMAC from an existing CAMMAC lacking a
        kdc-verifier if that CAMMAC is contained within a local TGT
        and all of the local realm KDCs are configured to filter out
        CAMMAC authorization data submitted by clients.
      </t>
      <t>
        An application service might not use the S4U2Proxy extension,
        or the realm policy might disallow the use of S4U2Proxy by
        that service.  In such situations where there is no flow of
        authorization data from the service to the KDC, the application service
        could modify the CAMMAC contents, but such modifications would
        have no effect on other services.  Because of the lack of
        security impact, the KDC MAY create a new
        CAMMAC from an existing CAMMAC lacking a kdc-verifier if it is
        inserting the new CAMMAC into a service ticket for the same
        service principal as the ticket that contained the existing
        CAMMAC, but MUST NOT place a kdc-verifier in the new CAMMAC.
      </t>
      <t>
        The kdc-verifier in CAMMAC does not bind the service principal
        name to the CAMMAC contents, because the service principal
        name is not part of the EncTicketPart.  An entity that has
        access to the keys of two different service principals can
        decrypt a ticket for one service and encrypt it in the key of
        the other service, altering the svc-verifier to match.  Both
        the kdc-verifier and the svc-verifier would still validate,
        but the KDC never issued this fabricated ticket.  The impact
        of this manipulation is minor if the CAMMAC contents only
        communicate attributes related to the client.  If an
        application requires an authenticated binding between the
        service principal name and the CAMMAC or ticket contents, the
        KDC MUST include in the CAMMAC some authorization data element
        that names the service principal.

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
